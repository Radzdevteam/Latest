# Publish an Android Library - A Beginner's Guide | Git | Github | Jitpack

This guide walks you through the process of publishing an Android library using JitPack. Whether you're developing a custom Android library or contributing to open-source, JitPack provides an easy way to distribute your libraries directly from GitHub.

## Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- A GitHub account
- JitPack account (optional, but recommended for easier integration)

## Steps to Publish Your Android Library

### 1. Set Up Your Project in Android Studio

First, you'll need to create a new Android Studio project or module. Follow these steps to ensure you're ready for publishing.

#### Create a New Module for JitPack
In your Android Studio project, create a new module specifically for the library you want to publish. This is important because JitPack requires a separate module with the necessary configurations.

### 2. Update the `build.gradle.kts` for the Module

In your library module, update the `build.gradle.kts` file with the following configuration to enable publishing.

#### Example `build.gradle.kts` (Module):
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("maven-publish")
}

publishing {
    repositories {
        maven {
            val releasesRepoUrl = layout.buildDirectory.dir("repos/releases")
            val snapshotsRepoUrl = layout.buildDirectory.dir("repos/snapshots")
            url = uri(if (project.hasProperty("release")) releasesRepoUrl else snapshotsRepoUrl)
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration sets up the Maven publishing plugin and determines where your library will be published based on whether you're releasing a stable version or a snapshot.

### 3. Create the JitPack Configuration File

In your project root directory, create a file named `jitpack.yml`. This file will contain the configuration JitPack uses to build your library.

#### Example `jitpack.yml`:
```yaml
jdk:
  - openjdk17

before_install:
  - sdk install java 17.0.12-open
  - sdk use java 17.0.12-open
```

This configuration specifies the JDK version required by your project (ensure that the JDK version matches what you are using in Android Studio).

### 4. Verify Your Android Studio JDK Version

To confirm the version of OpenJDK you're using, go to:
1. **File > Settings** (on Windows/Linux) or **Android Studio > Preferences** (on macOS)
2. Type `gradle` in the search bar
3. Check the JDK version listed under "Gradle JDK."

Ensure the version here aligns with the one you've specified in `jitpack.yml`.

### 5. Commit and Push to GitHub

Now that your project is ready for JitPack, commit all changes and push your project to GitHub.

### 6. Create a Release on GitHub

- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Click on the **Releases** tab.
- Create a **New Release**, for example, `v1.0`, and tag it accordingly.
- Copy the repository details (e.g., `Radzdevteam/Latest`).

### 7. Link to JitPack

- Log in to [JitPack](https://jitpack.io).
- Paste your GitHub repository URL in the field provided (e.g., `https://github.com/Radzdevteam/Latest`).
- JitPack will build your library and provide a URL that you can use to include your library in other projects.

### 8. Add the Dependency in Other Projects

Once your library is published, you can include it in any Android project by adding the following to the `build.gradle.kts` of the consuming project:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.Radzdevteam:Latest:1.0")
}
```

Replace `Radzdevteam`, `Latest`, and `1.0` with your GitHub username, repository name, and the version number you've released.

### Conclusion

You're now ready to share your Android library with the world! JitPack makes it easy to publish and distribute Android libraries, and with these simple steps, you can get started with your first published library. If you encounter any issues, check JitPackâ€™s logs or GitHub repository settings to troubleshoot.
